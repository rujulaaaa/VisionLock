# Welcome to Week 2

Welcome to Week 2 of our journey! This week, we step into the world of Deep Learning — the part of machine learning where models start learning rich representations directly from data instead of relying on hand-crafted rules.

>If things feel slightly more abstract this week, that’s completely okay. Deep Learning does take a bit of time to settle in. The aim here is not to rush, but to build intuition slowly and comfortably.

We’ll start by getting familiar with the most widely used Deep Learning frameworks — TensorFlow and PyTorch. These tools are essential, not because they’re fancy, but because they help us express ideas clearly and train models efficiently.
>DO NOT GET OVERWHELMED BY THEM

Once we’re comfortable with the tools, we’ll move on to understanding Neural Networks. Everything: how they work, why they work, and what’s really happening when people say that a model is “learning”.

Finally, we’ll take our first look at YOLOv8, a popular real-time object detection architecture, and explore how it approaches object detection and classification at a high level.

>Before starting, try not to spend too much time getting stuck on TensorFlow or Keras syntax. You’ll naturally get comfortable with frameworks over time. For now, put more emphasis on understanding deep learning concepts and YOLO principles.

>And one more thing, please document everything that you learn. You might also have to submit a midterm report of the same. I’ll also be uploading a few more resources under the Week 2 content to make Weeks 3 and 4 feel lighter and more manageable.
