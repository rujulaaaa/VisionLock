# Welcome to Week 2

In Week 1, we focused on building intuition—understanding data, basic ML ideas, and why things work the way they do.
This week, we take the next big step: Deep Learning.

Deep Learning is where models stop relying on hand-crafted features and instead learn representations directly from data. It might feel a bit overwhelming at first—and that’s completely normal. The goal this week is not to master everything, but to build a strong conceptual base and get comfortable with the tools we’ll use throughout the project.
