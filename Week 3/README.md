# Welcome to Week 3 

Welcome to **Week 3** of our Machine Learning journey!  
This week is where things start to feel *very* visual — we’ll be working directly with **images**, and learning how machines actually *see* them.

We’ll begin with **OpenCV**, a powerful library used to preprocess raw image data. Before a model can learn from images, those images need to be cleaned, resized, normalized, and sometimes denoised. OpenCV helps us do exactly that.

Once we’re comfortable preparing images, we’ll move on to **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**. CNNs are the neural networks specifically designed to work with image data. CNNs are the backbone of almost every modern vision system, and understanding them is a huge milestone.

## What we’ll focus on this week

1. **OpenCV for Image Preprocessing**
Before a neural network can learn anything useful from images, the images need to be prepared properly. Raw images can be noisy, too large, inconsistent in size, or poorly lit — and that can confuse the model. OpenCV helps us clean things up by resizing images to a fixed shape, normalizing pixel values, reducing noise using blurring, and enhancing important features. Think of OpenCV as doing all the “housekeeping” so the model gets clean, well-organized input to learn from.

2. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**   
CNNs are neural networks designed specifically to work with image data. Instead of looking at the entire image at once, CNNs scan small parts of the image using filters to detect simple patterns like edges, corners, and textures. As we go deeper into the network, these simple patterns get combined into more complex shapes and objects. This layered way of learning is what makes CNNs so powerful for tasks like image classification, object detection, and recognition.
