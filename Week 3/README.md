# Welcome to Week 3 

Welcome to **Week 3** of our Machine Learning journey!  
This week is where things start to feel *very* visual — we’ll be working directly with **images**, and learning how machines actually *see* them.

We’ll begin with **OpenCV**, a powerful library used to preprocess raw image data. Before a model can learn from images, those images need to be cleaned, resized, normalized, and sometimes denoised — and OpenCV helps us do exactly that.

Once we’re comfortable preparing images, we’ll move on to **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** — the neural networks specifically designed to work with image data. CNNs are the backbone of almost every modern vision system, and understanding them is a huge milestone.

This week is very hands-on. You’ll experiment with real image datasets, tweak preprocessing steps, train CNN models, and see how small changes affect results.

## What we’ll focus on this week

1. **OpenCV for Image Preprocessing**  
   We’ll learn how to:
   - Resize images
   - Normalize pixel values
   - Apply blurring and noise removal  
   This step is crucial — good preprocessing often matters as much as the model itself.

2. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**  
   We’ll explore:
   - Why CNNs work so well for images  
   - How convolutions and filters extract features  
   - How CNNs learn patterns like edges, shapes, and textures  

3. **Practice & Assignments**  
   This is where everything comes together.  
   You’ll apply preprocessing + CNNs on datasets and slowly build confidence working with image-based models.

> A small reminder: don’t rush this week. CNNs can feel abstract at first, but they make much more sense once you see them in action. Play around, experiment, and don’t worry about getting perfect results.

Have fun with it — this is where Machine Learning starts to look and feel like Computer Vision 🚀


1. We will begin with a brief revision of **[Python](https://scrimba.com/learn-python-c03)** fundamentals to ensure everyone is on the same page. *(You may skip this section if you are already familiar with Python.)*
2. We'll cover **[ML Libraries / Python Modules](https://github.com/rujulaaaa/VisionLock/tree/main/Week%201/ML%20Libraries)** to facilitate efficient data manipulation and visualization.
3. Our first ML concept will be **[Linear Regression](https://github.com/rujulaaaa/VisionLock/tree/main/Week%201/Linear%20regression)**, a powerful technique for modeling relationships between variables.
4. Next, we'll explore **[Logistic Regression](https://github.com/rujulaaaa/VisionLock/tree/main/Week%201/Logistic%20regression)**, a fundamental method for binary classification tasks.

>A quick heads-up: Split your time such that you end up spending more time on Linear and Logistic Regression and a bit (just a little bit) less on Python and ML Libraries

>And one more thing I’d really recommend: document whatever you learn just like you to take notes in your JEE classes. Write down every step, may be even add screenshots from the videos. It doesn’t have to be polished at all, even rough notes work perfectly. Your notes can be super informal too — mix of English, Hinglish, or whatever helps you understand things faster. What matters is that you can revisit them later. (And yes… you will need to revise this someday. Future you will be very grateful these notes exist.)
