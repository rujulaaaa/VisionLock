# Welcome to Week 1

Welcome to Week 1 of our journey! This week, we’ll lay the groundwork for everything that follows by getting comfortable with the core tools of the machine learning ecosystem. 

We’ll begin by working with essential Python libraries—NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib—which will help you handle data efficiently and visualize it effectively. From there, we’ll dive into the core building blocks of machine learning—starting with regression.

Some of these topics might not show up directly in our final project, but trust me, they’re the ones that quietly shape your intuition and make everything else feel easier later. And that’s what truly matters! As you work through each concept, you’ll start building the confidence and hands-on intuition needed to take on real computer vision problems. This is the part where the journey starts to feel real—and genuinely exciting.

1. We will begin with a brief revision of **[Python](https://scrimba.com/learn-python-c03)** fundamentals to ensure everyone is on the same page. *(You may skip this section if you are already familiar with Python.)*
2. We'll cover **[ML Libraries / Python Modules](https://github.com/rujulaaaa/VisionLock/tree/main/Week%201/ML%20Libraries)** to facilitate efficient data manipulation and visualization.
3. Our first ML concept will be **[Linear Regression](https://github.com/rujulaaaa/VisionLock/tree/main/Week%201/Linear%20regression)**, a powerful technique for modeling relationships between variables.
4. Next, we'll explore **[Logistic Regression](https://github.com/rujulaaaa/VisionLock/tree/main/Week%201/Logistic%20regression)**, a fundamental method for binary classification tasks.

>A quick heads-up: Split your time such that you end up spending more time on Linear and Logistic Regression and a bit (just a little bit) less on Python and ML Libraries

>And one more thing I’d really recommend: document whatever you learn just like you to take notes in your JEE classes. Write down every step, may be even add screenshots from the videos. It doesn’t have to be polished at all, even rough notes work perfectly. Your notes can be super informal too — mix of English, Hinglish, or whatever helps you understand things faster. What matters is that you can revisit them later. (And yes… you will need to revise this someday. Future you will be very grateful these notes exist.)
