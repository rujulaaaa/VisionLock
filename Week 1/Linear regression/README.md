# Getting Started With Machine Learning

After learning the important Python libraries, you are now ready to **begin your ML journey**.  
Before diving into algorithms, the first question is:

## Where Should You Code?

You can use **any** of the following environments—choose whatever feels easiest:

1. **Jupyter Notebook**  
   - [Watch this intro](https://youtu.be/IMrxB8Mq5KU?si=73A0gshAjoulxGxe) (till 6:00)  
   - [Installation guide](https://jupyter.org/install)

2. **Google Colab**  
   - Runs in your browser  
   - No setup required  
   - Free GPU (bonus!)

3. **VS Code Notebook** (`.ipynb` files)  
   - If you prefer coding locally  
   - Works great with Python extensions
  
> I prefer using VS Code Notebook. If you are a tech enthusiast, chances are that you will get your hands on more and more and more projects in your coming years and when that happens, having a proper VS Code setup becomes really handy. And even if you are not a tech enthusiast, trust me you'll have to code:(

# Linear Regression

To understand ML properly, we’ll begin with the most fundamental algorithm: Linear Regression.

Follow this playlist (recommended at 2x speed): [Linear Regression Playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkDaE6sCZn6FNC6YRfRQc_FbeQrF8BwGI&si=du3_teG9u82cUSNz)

### Watch the following topics:

1. **Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning** (Videos 3 – 7) - Understand how ML problems are categorized.
   >Just understand the concepts once. Don't spend way too much time here.

3. **Regression Model** (Videos 9 – 14) - Learn the mathematical idea behind predicting continuous values.
   >This is very very important for gaining a strong intution. Make sure you are fully focused here.

4. **Training With Gradient Descent** (Videos 15 – 20)  
   >It is one of those ideas that keeps showing up or you mostly build upon it. Once this clicks, a lot of the “advanced” stuff suddenly stops feeling advanced. Make sure you do understand every bit of it. Super important.

6. **Multiple Linear Regression** (Videos 21 – 30) - Extends linear regression to multiple features.

> A few tips before you start
>  - Don’t try to understand every formula on day one — intuition first, math later.
>  - If gradient descent feels confusing at first, that’s normal. Everyone replays that part.
>  - And once again ML is not about memorizing syntax. You should know it but should not prioratise it over understanding how things behave.

## What’s Next?

Once you finish this section, you should have a much clearer picture of what’s actually happening inside an ML model — not just the formulas, but the logic behind them.

You'll also notice something important as well as you move forward -a lot of ML algorithms start to look similar once you understand how Linear Regression works.
That’s why we spend time here as it makes everything that follows feel less random and more connected.

From here onward, the pace becomes a bit smoother. Concepts like Logistic Regression won’t feel completely new. they’ll feel like small twists on ideas you’ve already seen.
