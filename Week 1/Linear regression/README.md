# Getting Started With Machine Learning

After learning the important Python libraries, you are now ready to **begin your ML journey**.  
Before diving into algorithms, the first question is:

## 🖥️ Where Should You Code?

You can use **any** of the following environments—choose whatever feels easiest:

1. **Jupyter Notebook**  
   👉 [Watch this intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW29067qVWk) (till 6:00)  
   👉 [Installation guide](https://jupyter.org/install)

2. **Google Colab**  
   - Runs in your browser  
   - No setup required  
   - Free GPU (bonus!)

3. **VS Code Notebook** (`.ipynb` files)  
   - If you prefer coding locally  
   - Works great with Python extensions

# 📈 Linear Regression

To understand ML properly, we’ll begin with the most fundamental algorithm: **Linear Regression**.

Follow this **Playlist** (recommended at 2x speed):  
👉 [Linear Regression Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxWkKxKqDAqNwCu8FKqD9h5TmF-7hA3Jd)

### Watch the following topics:

1. **Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning**  
   *(Videos 3 – 7)*  
   Understand how ML problems are categorized.

2. **Regression Model**  
   *(Videos 9 – 14)*  
   Learn the mathematical idea behind predicting continuous values.

3. **Training With Gradient Descent**  
   *(Videos 15 – 20)*  
   This is how ML models actually learn — super important concept.

4. **Multiple Linear Regression**  
   *(Videos 21 – 30)*  
   Extends linear regression to multiple features.

## 🚀 What’s Next?

Once you're done with these videos, you'll:

- Understand how ML models learn  
- Be ready to code your own Linear Regression from scratch  
- Have the foundation for advanced algorithms later

You're doing great — keep going!  
If you want, I can also create a **folder structure**, **next steps**, or a **combined roadmap README** for your whole ML repo.
