Learning Python Modules: NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib

- **[Numpy](https://youtu.be/QUT1VHiLmmI?si=_9fS5UEdJ1tnISqH)** (Refer **[this](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/absolute_beginners.html)** documentation if you have any doubts)

- **[Pandas](https://youtu.be/ZyhVh-qRZPA?si=woMaerkq0-6Q6-So)** (If you prefer videos you can refer **[this](https://www.w3schools.com/python/pandas/default.asp)** )

- **[Matplotlib](https://www.w3schools.com/python/matplotlib_intro.asp)**

>Just a quick note (because beginners often stress about this): You don’t need to learn or memorize every bit of the syntax or mug up every function. Seriously. When you’re doing your assignment or even the project, the only thing you really need to be clear about is this:
      For almost every task you want to do, a library function already exists.
      Whether it's NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, or something else — someone has already written the function you need.
      Your job is not to memorize all of it.
      Your job is to understand what you want to do, and know that you can look up the function whenever you need it.

>That’s how real developers work, and that’s how you should approach your ML journey too.
 The syntax will come naturally with practice — don’t force it.]
